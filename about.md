My name is Mirko Miorelli and I am Physicist pursuing a career in Data Science and Machine Learning. I obtained my PhD (2018) in Theoretical Physics at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC).

I am interested in scientific programming, data analysis and learning algorithms. I love challenging problems and enjoy coding (mainly Python and C++), as well as understanding the math behind a specific problem.

When I am not coding you can probably find me kayaking or hiking around Vancouver, so watch out!
